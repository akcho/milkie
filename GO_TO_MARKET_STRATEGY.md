# Go-to-Market Strategy for Milkie

## Executive Summary

**Milkie** is a drop-in paywall infrastructure for Next.js apps that reduces subscription implementation from days to minutes. This GTM strategy outlines how to achieve widespread adoption among Next.js developers, indie hackers, and SaaS builders through developer-focused marketing, community engagement, and strategic partnerships.

**Current Status:** v0.4.1 - Production Ready
**Target:** 1,000+ weekly npm downloads within 6 months
**Primary Goal:** Become the default paywall solution for Next.js developers

---

## 1. Market Analysis & Positioning

### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
- 1M+ Next.js developers globally
- 100,000+ Next.js projects on GitHub
- Growing SaaS/subscription economy ($700B+ market)

**Target Market Segments:**
1. **Indie Hackers** - Solo developers building SaaS products (Primary)
2. **Small Dev Teams** - 2-10 person startups needing quick monetization
3. **Agencies** - Building client subscription products
4. **Side Project Builders** - Developers monetizing hobby projects

### Positioning Statement

**For** Next.js developers who need to add subscriptions fast,
**Milkie** is a paywall infrastructure library
**That** reduces implementation from 2 days to 15 minutes
**Unlike** building from scratch or using full-stack platforms like Supabase,
**Milkie** is a lightweight, auth-agnostic component library that works with your existing stack.

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Milkie | Building from Scratch | Supabase/Firebase |
|---------|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 15 minutes | 2+ days | Hours (but vendor lock-in) |
| **Auth Flexibility** | Any provider | Custom | Platform-specific |
| **Customization** | Fully customizable | Complete control | Limited |
| **Complexity** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Cost** | Free (OSS) | Development time | Platform fees |

## Appendix B: Example Launch Posts

### Hacker News "Show HN" Template

**Title:** "Show HN: Milkie – Drop-in paywall infrastructure for Next.js"

**Body:**
```
Hey HN! I built Milkie to solve a problem I kept running into:
adding Stripe subscriptions to Next.js apps takes way too long.

Every time I started a new SaaS project, I'd spend 2+ days
building the same paywall infrastructure: checkout sessions,
webhook handlers, subscription status checks, gating components, etc.

Milkie reduces this to 15 minutes:

1. Create 3 API routes (we provide factory functions)
2. Wrap your app with <MilkieProvider>
3. Gate content with <PaywallGate>

Key features:
- Works with ANY auth provider (NextAuth, Clerk, Lucia, etc.)
- Fully customizable UI
- Built-in security (PII sanitization, idempotency, etc.)
- Production-ready with TypeScript

Live demo: https://milkie.dev
GitHub: https://github.com/akcho/milkie

I'd love feedback from the HN community. What features would
make this more useful for your projects?
```

### Twitter Launch Thread

```
🚀 Launching Milkie today!

Drop-in paywall infrastructure for Next.js apps.

Add Stripe subscriptions in 15 minutes instead of 2 days.

🧵 Here's what makes it different: (1/8)

---

1/ Works with ANY auth provider

You're not locked into a specific auth solution.

NextAuth? ✅
Clerk? ✅
Lucia? ✅
Supabase? ✅

Just pass the user's email to MilkieProvider. (2/8)

---

2/ Ridiculously simple setup

3 API routes. That's it.

We provide factory functions. You provide database adapters.

<PaywallGate> component handles the rest. (3/8)

---

3/ Fully customizable

Don't like our default UI? Cool.

- Change the text
- Reposition the overlay
- Replace with your own component

Your brand, your rules. (4/8)

---

4/ Production-ready security

Built-in:
- Callback URL validation
- Idempotency keys
- PII sanitization
- Webhook signature verification

Sleep well at night. (5/8)

---

5/ MIT licensed, completely free

No hidden costs. No usage limits.

Use it commercially. Modify it. Fork it.

Open source forever. (6/8)

---

6/ Try the live demo

See it in action: https://milkie.dev

Sign in with Google (or don't)
Test checkout: 4242 4242 4242 4242
See how fast it is. (7/8)

---

7/ Built by a solo dev, for solo devs

I made this because I was tired of building the same
infrastructure for every SaaS project.

Now I ship in hours instead of days.

Hope it helps you too! (8/8)
