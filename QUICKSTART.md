## ðŸš¢ Deploy Your Own (20 min)

Want to host your own demo? See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full instructions.

Quick version:
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Add environment variables (Google OAuth + Stripe)
3. Configure webhooks
4. Done!

## ðŸ’» Run Locally (15 min)

Want to test locally or integrate into your own app?

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Google Cloud account (for OAuth)
- Stripe account (test mode is free)
- Stripe CLI (for webhook testing)

## Step 1: Set Up Google OAuth (3 min)

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Click **"Create Credentials"** â†’ **"OAuth 2.0 Client ID"**
4. Configure consent screen if prompted (External, add your email)
5. Application type: **Web application**
6. Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
7. Click **"Create"** and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## Step 2: Get Stripe Keys (2 min)

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Copy these two keys:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

## Step 2: Create a Product (2 min)

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
2. Click **"Add product"**
3. Fill in:
   - Name: "Premium Subscription"
   - Description: Whatever you want
   - Price: $10.00
   - Billing period: Monthly (recurring)
4. Click **"Save product"**
5. Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)

## Step 3: Set Up the Project (3 min)

```bash
# Clone and navigate to demo
cd demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login
```

## Step 4: Configure Environment (2 min)

Edit `demo/.env.local` and paste your keys:

```env
# Google OAuth (from Step 1)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# NextAuth Secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
AUTH_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here

# Stripe (from Steps 2 & 3)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_YOUR_PRICE_ID_HERE

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Generate AUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Step 5: Run It (2 min)

**Terminal 1 - Start the app:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Forward webhooks:**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**Important**: Copy the webhook secret from Terminal 2 (starts with `whsec_`)

Add it to `.env.local`:
```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
```

Restart Terminal 1 (Ctrl+C then `npm run dev` again)

## Step 6: Test the Flow

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click **"Sign In"** â†’ Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Single Premium Page"** or **"Full App (Paywalled)"**
4. You'll see the paywall showing your email
5. Click **"Subscribe Now"**
6. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
7. Any future expiry date, any CVC
8. Complete checkout
9. You're redirected back with access!

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. You click subscribe â†’ Creates a Stripe checkout session
2. You enter payment â†’ Stripe processes it
3. Webhook fires â†’ Updates your local database
4. You're redirected â†’ App checks subscription status
5. You have access! â†’ Content is unlocked

## Troubleshooting

### "Configuration" error or can't sign in with Google
- Make sure your Google Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Check that the redirect URI `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` is added in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure `AUTH_SECRET` is set in `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after adding credentials

### "Webhook signature verification failed"
- Make sure you copied the webhook secret from Terminal 2
- Make sure you added it to `.env.local`
- Make sure you restarted the dev server

### "Failed to create checkout session"
- Check your Stripe secret key is correct
- Check the price ID is correct (starts with `price_`, not `prod_`)
- Look at Terminal 1 for error messages

### "Subscription status check failed"
- Make sure the webhook secret is set up
- Check that Terminal 2 (stripe listen) is running
- Look at Terminal 2 to see if webhooks are being received

## Next Steps

Once it's working:
1. Try accessing the premium content again - you should still have access (persisted in database)
2. Sign out and sign back in - you'll still have access (subscription is tied to your email)
3. Look at the code in `demo/lib/milkie/` - that's the SDK
4. Look at `demo/app/premium/page.tsx` - see how simple the integration is
5. Try integrating into your own app - works with NextAuth, Clerk, Lucia, Supabase, etc.

## Understanding the Code

**The SDK** (`demo/lib/milkie/`):
- This is what would be published to npm
- Developers would `npm install milkie` and import these components
- It's currently ~200 lines of code

**The demo app**:
- Shows how a developer would use the SDK
- In production, each developer would run their own version
- The API routes would eventually be hosted by you (Milkie platform)

## What This Proves

If this works, you've validated:
- âœ… Stripe integration works
- âœ… Webhooks work
- âœ… The SDK works
- âœ… The developer experience is simple
- âœ… The concept makes sense

Now you can show this to other developers and get their feedback!
