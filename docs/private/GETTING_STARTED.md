# Getting Started with Milkie

You now have a working prototype! Here's what we built and what to do next.

## What You Have

A complete, working paywall system that includes:

1. **Demo App** (`/demo`) - A Next.js app showing how developers would use Milkie
2. **The SDK** (`/demo/lib/milkie`) - The actual components developers would install
3. **Stripe Integration** - Full checkout and webhook handling
4. **Database** - Simple SQLite for storing subscriptions

## Try It Out

1. Go to the demo folder:
```bash
cd demo
```

2. Follow the setup instructions in `demo/README.md`

3. The key steps are:
   - Get Stripe API keys
   - Create a product in Stripe
   - Set up environment variables
   - Run the Stripe CLI for webhooks
   - Test the paywall flow

## The Core Innovation

The `lib/milkie` folder contains the SDK. Look at how simple it is to use:

```tsx
// Wrap your app
<MilkieProvider>
  <App />
</MilkieProvider>

// Protect any content
<PaywallGate>
  <PremiumFeature />
</PaywallGate>

// Check subscription status
const { hasAccess } = usePaywall();
```

That's it! Three components and you have a paywall.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Test the demo** - Make sure everything works
2. **Get feedback** - Show it to a few developer friends
3. **Document the DX** - Write down what's confusing

### Short-term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. **Extract the SDK** - Move `lib/milkie` to a separate package
2. **Publish to npm** - Make it installable: `npm install milkie`
3. **Add examples** - Create templates for different frameworks
4. **Basic landing page** - Explain what Milkie is and how to use it

### Medium-term (1-3 Months)
1. **Build the dashboard** - Where developers sign up and get API keys
2. **Multi-tenancy** - Support multiple developers using the platform
3. **Webhook relay** - Forward Stripe webhooks to customer apps
4. **Better auth** - Replace email-only with proper authentication
5. **Analytics** - Show developers their MRR, churn, etc.

### Long-term (3-6 Months)
1. **Additional features** - Usage tracking, quota limits, multiple pricing tiers
2. **More payment providers** - Not just Stripe
3. **International support** - Multi-currency, localization
4. **Community** - Discord, docs site, tutorials

## Key Decisions to Make

1. **Monetization timing** - When do you start charging?
   - Option A: Free beta, gather users, charge later
   - Option B: Charge from day 1 (validates willingness to pay)

2. **Open source?** - Do you open source the SDK?
   - Pros: Trust, contributions, distribution
   - Cons: Harder to monetize core product

3. **Target market** - Stay focused on indie hackers or expand?
   - Stay narrow initially to nail the product
   - Expand once you have strong word of mouth

## Architecture Questions

As you build, you'll need to decide:

1. **How do customers deploy?**
   - Self-hosted (they run the code)
   - Managed service (you host everything)
   - Hybrid (SDK is client-side, API is managed)

2. **Database strategy**
   - One database for all customers (easier)
   - Separate databases per customer (more secure)

3. **API design**
   - REST vs GraphQL
   - Authentication method
   - Rate limiting approach

## Resources You'll Need

- **Stripe docs**: https://stripe.com/docs
- **Stripe Connect docs**: https://stripe.com/docs/connect (for accessing customer Stripe accounts)
- **Next.js docs**: https://nextjs.org/docs
- **Publishing npm packages**: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages

## Validation Checklist

Before building too much, validate:

- [ ] Can you get 10 developers interested in using this?
- [ ] Do they understand the value proposition?
- [ ] Would they pay for it once they're making money?
- [ ] Is the integration actually as easy as you think?
- [ ] What's the #1 feature they'd want that's missing?

## Marketing Ideas

When you're ready to share:

1. **Twitter/X** - Share the journey of building it
2. **Indie Hackers** - Post in the forum
3. **Reddit** - r/SideProject, r/webdev
4. **Hacker News** - "Show HN: Milkie - NextAuth for payments"
5. **Product Hunt** - When you have a landing page
6. **Dev.to** - Write a technical post about building it
