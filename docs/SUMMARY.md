# Milkie - What We Built

## Overview
We just built a **working prototype** of Milkie - a drop-in paywall infrastructure for developers. Think "NextAuth but for payments."

## What's Working Right Now

### âœ… Complete Features
1. **The SDK** (`demo/lib/milkie/`)
   - `<MilkieProvider>` - Context provider for subscription state
   - `<PaywallGate>` - Component that blocks content for non-subscribers
   - `usePaywall()` - Hook to access subscription status

2. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Stripe checkout session creation
   - Webhook handling for subscription events
   - SQLite database for users and subscriptions
   - Entitlement checking API

3. **Demo Application**
   - Home page explaining the concept
   - Free content page (accessible to all)
   - Premium content page (protected by paywall)
   - Success page after checkout

### ðŸŽ¯ The Core Value Proposition
A developer can add a paywall to their app in literally 3 steps:

```tsx
// 1. Wrap your app
<MilkieProvider>
  <App />
</MilkieProvider>

// 2. Protect content
<PaywallGate>
  <PremiumFeature />
</PaywallGate>

// 3. That's it!
```

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout & Webhooks
- **Deployment**: Can deploy anywhere Next.js runs

## What Makes This Different

### vs. Stripe Directly
- âœ… Pre-built UI components
- âœ… Entitlement logic handled
- âœ… Webhook relay (planned)
- âœ… Session management
- âœ… 5-minute setup vs 2-day integration

### vs. Lemon Squeezy / Gumroad
- âœ… Connect your own Stripe (lower fees)
- âœ… Full control over checkout flow
- âœ… Not a merchant of record (simpler)

### vs. Building It Yourself
- âœ… No webhook debugging
- âœ… No security concerns
- âœ… No subscription state management
- âœ… Copy-paste integration

## Next Steps

### To Test It Locally
1. `cd demo`
2. Follow the setup in `demo/README.md`
3. You'll need a Stripe account and the Stripe CLI
4. Should take ~10 minutes to get running

### To Validate the Idea
1. Show it to 10-20 developer friends
2. Ask: "Would you use this?"
3. Get feedback on the developer experience
4. See if anyone would pay for it

### To Ship It (3-6 Months)
1. **Week 1-2**: Extract SDK to npm package
2. **Month 1**: Build developer dashboard
3. **Month 2**: Add multi-tenancy and webhook relay
4. **Month 3**: Launch publicly, gather users
5. **Month 4-6**: Add features based on feedback

## The Opportunity

**Target Market**: Indie hackers, side project builders, "vibe coders"
**Problem**: Adding payments is too hard for weekend projects
**Solution**: Drop-in paywall that "just works"
**Moat**: Developer experience + webhook infrastructure

**Monetization**:
- Free tier: Up to $1k MRR or 100 customers
- Paid tier: 2% of MRR after that
- Scales naturally as customers grow

## Why This Could Work

1. **Clear pain point** - Every indie hacker hits this
2. **Simple positioning** - "NextAuth for payments"
3. **Natural growth** - Developers share tools that help them ship
4. **Fair pricing** - Only pay when you're making money
5. **Expansion path** - Can add features and move upmarket

## Why This Might Not Work

1. **Competition** - Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy exist
2. **Complexity** - Webhook relay is hard to build reliably
3. **Trust** - Payments are sensitive, need to build credibility
4. **Market size** - Indie hackers are small, need to expand eventually

## The Current State

**Status**: Working prototype, not production-ready
**Can it process real payments?**: Yes (in test mode)
**Is it secure?**: Basic security, needs audit
**Is it scalable?**: SQLite is fine for demo, needs real DB for production

## What You Should Do Now

1. **Test it** - Get it running locally and try the flow
2. **Show people** - Gauge interest and get feedback
3. **Decide** - Is this worth pursuing?
4. **Ship fast** - If yes, aim for an MVP in 4-6 weeks

## Files to Look At

### The SDK (what developers use)
- [demo/lib/milkie/provider.tsx](demo/lib/milkie/provider.tsx) - State management
- [demo/lib/milkie/paywall-gate.tsx](demo/lib/milkie/paywall-gate.tsx) - Paywall component

### The API (how it works)
- [demo/app/api/checkout/route.ts](demo/app/api/checkout/route.ts) - Create checkout
- [demo/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts](demo/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts) - Handle webhooks

### Example Usage
- [demo/app/premium/page.tsx](demo/app/premium/page.tsx) - How to protect content

**You now have a working foundation.** The question is: do you want to turn this into a product?
